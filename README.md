# elevate-delta elevator application

The elevator application has the purpose to recognize if an elevator is moving 
and to provide this information to [accessibility.cloud](accessibility.cloud).

The project is a cooperation between [Sozialhelden](sozialhelden.de) and [Ubirch](ubirch.de).

Further information will follow soon.
